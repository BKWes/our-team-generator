# Team Profile Generator

## Description:
This is a team generator that I made for a coding boot camp. The purpose of this generator is to input employee data into the command line, through Inquirer, and return an html page with this data.

## User Story
AS A manager  
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info  
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles  

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input  
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information  
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input  
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML  
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address  
WHEN I click on the GitHub username  
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab  
WHEN I start the application  
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number  
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number  
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team  
WHEN I select the engineer option  
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu  
WHEN I select the intern option  
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu  
WHEN I decide to finish building my team  
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
